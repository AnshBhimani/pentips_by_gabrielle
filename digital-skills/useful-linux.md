### Extract unique occurrence from 2 files

- You have to files and you want to extract unique values and put them in a new file (file1 should be the one with the more lines)
  - `awk 'FNR==NR {a[$0]++; next} !($0 in a)' file1 file2` Command found on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4717250/extracting-unique-values-between-2-sets-files)
  - Explanation of how the code works:
    If we're working on file1, track each line of text we see.  
    If we're working on file2, and have not seen the line text, then print it.  
    Explanation of details:  

    FNR is the current file's record number  
    NR is the current overall record number from all input files  
    FNR==NR is true only when we are reading file1  
    $0 is the current line of text  
    a[$0] is a hash with the key set to the current line of text  
    a[$0]++ tracks that we've seen the current line of text  
    !($0 in a) is true only when we have not seen the line text  
    Print the line of text if the above pattern returns true, this is the default awk behavior when no explicit action is given
