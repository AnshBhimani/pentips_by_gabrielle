# FTP

- Usually on port 21

## What to try

- Check if anonymous FTP is enabled, if so check if you can downloads files. If so you can RCE.  
Check out [Hackthebox Devel's writeup](../writeups/HTB-Devel.md) to have an example of this.

- If you do not have write access you could still find interesting and useful files like passwords or else.
