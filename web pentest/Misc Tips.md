- At the end of "Command" add `--ignore-certificate-errors–` and save, the command should look like this now:
```
/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U --ignore-certificate-errors–
```

## Burp authentication failures

*If the application you are testing uses platform authentication (which normally shows as a popup login dialog within your browser), and you get authentication failure messages when your browser is configured to use Burp, then you need to configure Burp to handle the platform authentication instead of your browser. 
Go to the User options > Connections tab, and the Platform Authentication section. 
Add a new entry for each hostname used by your application, configuring the authentication type and your credentials. 
If you aren't sure of the authentication type, then first try NTLMv2, then NTLMv1, and then the other types. 
You may need to close all browser windows and open a new browser window, to prevent any browser caching from interfering with the authentication process. 
Check that you are not overriding these settings in the Project options > Connections tab.*
