## How to report it

*Note: Here is an example on how to report it, CVSS score is here as a reference but you should always check out the context of your customer to calculate it*

## Description
An *iFrame* is a component of an HTML element that allows documents, videos and interactive media to be embedded in a page. By doing so, it is possible to display a secondary Web page on the main page.
The *iFrame* element allows you to include a piece of content from other sources. It can embed the content anywhere on the page, without having to include it in the structure of the Web layout, like a traditional element.
However, *iFrames* should be used securely as they can be a security risk.

## Remediation
There are two main ways to prevent clickjacking:

1. Send the correct *Content Security Policy* (CSP) *frame-ancestors* response headers that tell the browser not to allow framing from other domains. (This directive replaces the old HTTP X-Frame-Options headers).
2. Use of defensive code in the user interface to ensure that the current *frame* is the highest level window.
