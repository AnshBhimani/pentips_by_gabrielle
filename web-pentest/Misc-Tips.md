# Web App pentest - Misc tips

## Bypass Cert not private error on Chrome - Kali

***Warning: use we caution and only in your pentest environment/vm***  
Sometimes when you test a website you get an annoying error related to the certificates when you have to go back to it multiple times a day it can be a paint to click on ignore every time. 
Here is a quick fix for this
- In kali right click on Google Chrome and select Edit Application   
![Edit Application](https://csbygb.github.io/img/chrome-edit-app.png)
- At the end of "Command" add `--ignore-certificate-errors` and save, the command should look like this now:
```
/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %U --ignore-certificate-errors
```

## Burp authentication failures

*If the application you are testing uses platform authentication (which normally shows as a popup login dialog within your browser), and you get authentication failure messages when your browser is configured to use Burp, then you need to configure Burp to handle the platform authentication instead of your browser.   
Go to the User options > Connections tab, and the Platform Authentication section.  
Add a new entry for each hostname used by your application, configuring the authentication type and your credentials.  
If you aren't sure of the authentication type, then first try NTLMv2, then NTLMv1, and then the other types.  
You may need to close all browser windows and open a new browser window, to prevent any browser caching from interfering with the authentication process.  
Check that you are not overriding these settings in the Project options > Connections tab.*

-   I am more a Firefox user but when I have to use an alternate browser I use this extension it usually works pretty well. However the best method for Chrome, in my opinion, would be to use the new incognito window and allow foxyproxy in it, I find it more convenient.
