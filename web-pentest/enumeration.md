# Web - Enumeration

## Names

When looking at a website check out names mentioned there, they are worth writing down for later.
For instance if the website is part of a network pentest (internal or external network with a webmail interface accessible we can try them for password spraying attacks)

### Namemash

Will output a list of usernames from list with firstname and lastname.  

Usage:  
```
python3 namemash.py names.txt
```

## Gobuster

One of my favorite tool is gobuster because you can enumerate subdomain along with directories and it goes really fast compared to other fuzzers.
- Enumerate directories: `gobuster dir -u http://domainname.com/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`
- Enumerate subdomains: `gobuster dns -d domainname.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/big.txt`
