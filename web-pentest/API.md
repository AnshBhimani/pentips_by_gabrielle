# API Tests

## Misc tips

- With an API we need to check as many endpoints as possible sometimes an endpoint will be protected but another will not have the same protection.
- A great methodology to use is the one made by [David Sopas - MindAPI](https://dsopas.github.io/MindAPI/play/)
- To not forget also to try to enumerate id if for instance you have http://api/user/ try to put 1 in the end you might get user enumeration this way
- When interactig with json in burpsuite repeater if we find an endpoint we have to add the content type like this in the headers `Content-Type: application/json`

## Kiterunner

- We can fetch the latest release [here](https://github.com/assetnote/kiterunner) or follow the guide if we want to build the binary.
  - Large routes list in kite fetchable [here](https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/data/kiterunner/routes-large.kite.tar.gz)
  - Small routes list in kite fetchable[here](https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/data/kiterunner/routes-small.kite.tar.gz)

- Useful commands:
  - Basic scan: `kr scan https://<ip>/ -w routes-large.kite`
  - Pass the Bearer token (to avoid getting too many 403): `sudo ./kr scan https://<IP>/ -w routes-small.kite -H 'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN-HERE'`
  - We can specify in the url /api/vX if we have it but kiterunner can also find it for us with the basic scan.
    Alissa Knight's whitepaper explains this very well: *"By default, when depth isn’t specified, Kiterunner will scan a target at 1 level deep, meaning if you specified a target of server.com, Kiterunner would scan server.com/api. At level 2, it would scan server.com/api/R4 and at level 3, it would scan server.com/api/R4/patient."*
  - To send to Burp Suite append the command with: `--proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8080` (this is done with replay not with scan)

## RESTler

*"RESTler, developed at Microsoft, is the world’s first stateful API fuzzer that automatically generates tests and automatic execution by first reading the OpenAPI specification in order to automatically find vulnerabilities in the API."*

- Fetch it [here](https://github.com/microsoft/restler-fuzzer)
- *"If you receive a nuget error NU1403 when building, a quick workaround is to clear your cache with this command: $ dotnet nuget locals all--clear"*
- Quite a pain to install on kali.

## wfuzz

This tool will allow to enumerate methods for API which is really convenient. It is preinstalled on kali.
- `wfuzz -X METHOD -w /path/to/wordlist -u http://URL/FUZZ` where you see `FUZZ` it will replace with words from the wordlist and as for `METHOD` you can use GET POST and any other http verb
- if you add the option `--hc ` you can hide specific codes like 404 for instance `--hc 404,405`
- Check out this [doc](https://wfuzz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/basicusage.html) for more infor on this tool

## API test full burp

If you want to test only using burp it is possible.
- Check out the burp extention [OpenAPI Parser](https://github.com/portswigger/openapi-parser)

### You got postman files?

- Do not panic! You can convert them using [Postman to OpenApi](https://github.com/joolfe/postman-to-openapi)
- `sudo apt install npm ` Install nmp if you do not have it
- `sudo npm i postman-to-openapi -g ` install postman to openapi cli mode
- `p2o myfile.postman_collection.json -f myfile.yml` convert your first file

### How to proceed

- First install the OpenApi Parser extension in burp. You just need to search it in the BApp store and click on install when you find it

- Then you will need to import the yaml file. Click in the tap "OpenAPI Parser" in burp ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96747355/168663122-0aa8f65c-0008-4279-af40-3797f19c20e8.png)  
- Click on browse and choose your yaml file

- The window will then be populated with the requests from the yaml.

## Postman

### Setting up baseurl

To give the base url variable a valid value, select the root of the collection  
And on the middle panel select variables. Add your host in the current value (for instance https://myhost.com), select the url and select Set as variable.  
It should look like this:  
![Set as variable](../.res/current-value.png)  
Set the proper authorization, configure postman with burp (if you do not know how check out Hakluke and Farah Hawa article in the resources below), and you should be able to send requests

### Bearer Token

If you use a bearer token and do not want to set up authentication, you can just add a current token in the Authozization tab or the collection's root.
**Important: Do not forget to Save your changes because it wont work if you don't**  
After this you just have to set the other to inherit auth from parent and you should be good to go.
