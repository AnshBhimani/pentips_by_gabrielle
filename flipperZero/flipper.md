# Flipper Zero

## Out of the box

Once you've received your Flipper Zero, you will need to set it up.

### SD Card

You will need an SD card in order to play with your flipper zero, it is pretty much useless without it.  
You can not buy any SD card, you will need a specific one, see [here](https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/sd-card) the requirements.  
You can also check the same link to format the SD Card through the flipper. It is pretty straightforward.
They mention in the documentation that it is not necessary to buy one that is more than 32 GB even though it will still work with more.
[Here](https://a.co/d/2WEUbgd) is the one I got from Amazon Canada.

### Update firmware

Once the SD card is inserted and formatted, you will be able to update the firmware. Here is how to do this:

1. Get the app on your computer from this [link](https://docs.flipperzero.one/qflipper)
2. Install it
3. Plug your flipper to your computer and update the firmware, really straightforward as well.

> For more information, you have the full chapter about the firmware update in the documentation [here](https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/firmware-update).

## Infrared

Once again something really simple you can clone a remote. Here is how to do it:

1. In the menu go to Infrared
2. Click on learn new remote
3. Point the remote at the IR port and push the button

Now you can use your flipper as a remote. Pretty cool.
