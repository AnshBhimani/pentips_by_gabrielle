## How to create an AWS account

In order to be able to query an s3 bucket that has misconfigured permissions like for example that gives access to its bucket to any authenticated user, we need to create a user in AWS (this is free)  

1. Create a free account on Amazon (check out the resources below for help on this step)

2. Head to the IAM console [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)

3. Go to "users" > "Add users" and follow the whole process it should be pretty straight forward refer to [this documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) in case you hesitate about something.

4. Make sure you kept all the infos about your user on your password manager you will need for awscli.

5. In order for your user to be able to query other buckets you will need to give it permissions.  
You can do this by adding it to a group. Go to your user

- Click on the tab "Groups"
- Click on "add a user to groups"
- Click on "create a group", create one an give it a name, it is really helpful to use the premaid permissions policies (I chose the one called `AdministratorAccess`)
- Name your group add your user to it and you should be good to go!

## Connect to a bucket

- If we found a key or buckets during enumeration, we need to check them and see if we can connect to them.

- `sudo apt install awscli` install aws cli
- `aws configure --profile profilename` create a profile with our configs from our created user
- `aws configure list` check your current configuration
- `aws configure list --profile profilename` check the config of a specific profile
- `aws s3 ls s3://target --profile profilename` ls the content of a bucket
- `aws s3 ls  s3://target --no-sign-request --region us-west-2`
