# External Pentest

## Rules of engagement

- The doc should be signed and as a pentester you should have a copy

## Verify scope

- [Scan the IP addess with this to verify it actually belongs to the company](https://bgp.he.net/)

## Vuln Scan

Todo first thing in the morning
- [OpenVAS - Open Source](https://www.openvas.org/)
- [Nessus](https://fr.tenable.com/products/nessus?tns_redirect=true)

## OSINT

### Hunting breach credentials

- [breach-parse](https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse)
- [Dehashed](https://dehashed.com/)
- [Have I been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

### Identifying Emails & Employees

- Get info on the naming convention for email (firstname.lastname or else)
- [Phonebook](https://phonebook.cz/), find email address
- Look for the company on Linkedin, use tools to scrape Linkedin and put them together using the deducted naming convention

### Enumerating valid accounts

- Check login form or password reset forms for user enum

### Other useful info

- Job postings (info about app used at the company
- Google dork to find password policy (site:target)

## Attack login portals

- Password strategy: currentSeasonOrMonth+currentYear+aSpecialChar, location, address, company name,  ...

### O365

- Password Spraying
  - [TREVORspray](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/TREVORspray)
  - We use the email list from the reconnaissance phase
  - Good to start with a delay of 15 `--delay 15`
  - `--no-current-ip` will proxy through each machine, more stealthy
  - Careful with account lockout = good to know account lockout policy prior to pentest
  - Using AWS we can make multiple ubuntu machine for free
  - Trevorspray is going to ssh first we have to accept fingerprinting everytime and then it is going to password spray
  - Trevorspsray will remember which pass previously used

### OWA (Outlook Web Access)

- Password Spraying
  - Metasploit: Scanner owa_login
  - set a password
  - set an RHOST (IP adr of target)
  - set user_file
  - checkout owa version to be sure it is the same
  - Even if pass does not work we will get a list of valid users

### Other portals

- Burp Suite Intruder (works better with pro version)
  - Intercept a request and set the vars 
  - Check out the error message and add it in intruder options (Grep Match)
  - Launch intruder

### Bypassing MFA

- [MFASweep](https://github.com/dafthack/MFASweep)

## Escalating Access

- If we get an email account, office for instance we can look for info or creds in the mailbox
- portal.azure.com if you login with a user you found you can find other accounts
- Then password spray with previous password found
- Be creative

## Common pentest findings

### Insufficient Authentication Controls

- Bypass MFA
- No MFA

### Weak Password Policy

- Recommand deny list
- Recommand NIST or OWASP Guidelines

### Insufficient Patching

- Some unpatch software have high severity CVE

### Default Credentials

- [List of default creds - SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials)
- [Default Passwords - Cirt](https://cirt.net/passwords)
- [Default creds cheat sheet - ihebski](https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet/blob/main/DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet.csv)

### Insufficient Encryption

- In case of http
- Weak ciphers
- [TestSSL](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh)
- [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) ***Note: Make sure to check "Do not show results on boad" for the confidentiality of your customer***

### Information Disclosure

- Verbose error message
- Verbose stack trace
- mDNS
- Server version and languages in response header

### Username Enumeration

- Most of the time visible through login portals with msg like "Invalid username"
- Possible also through reset password forms

### Default Web Pages

- Apache Pages
- IIS Page

### Open Mail Relay

- [How to test for Open mail relays - BlackHills Infosec](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/how-to-test-for-open-mail-relays/)

### IKE Aggressive Mode

- Could capture a preshared key of a vpn to access the network (most of the time hard to exploit)
- [ike-scan](https://github.com/royhills/ike-scan)

### Unexpected Perimeter Services

- RDP
- Telnet
- etc.

### Insufficient Traffic Blocking

- [Shotsherpa](https://shotsherpa.com/)
- Geo-blocking not in place
- Limits attack surface
- Depends on the customer location of the client

### Undetected Malicious Activity

- Bruteforce login attacks
- Nmap
- Nessus
- Web enum bruteforce
- etc.

### Historical Account Compromises

- Published breaches
